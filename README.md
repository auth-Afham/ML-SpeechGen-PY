This Python script integrates speech recognition with a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict and speak the words spoken by the user. It captures audio input, converts it to text using the Google Web Speech API, and processes the recognized words to build a dataset. The script then trains a Random Forest classifier with the dataset, predicts the next spoken words, and uses text-to-speech to articulate the prediction. The script allows continuous speech recognition until the user exits. The dataset is stored in a CSV file, and the trained model is saved for future use.
